## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Fix bugs before new features — user-reported 5 broken/degraded features in existing system
- Roadmap: Phase 2 (stale items) must precede Phase 3 (latency) — faster scanning without stale dedup increases "not joinable" error rate

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: Steam DOM selectors (`#you_notready`, `.btn_green_steamui.btn_medium`, `#trade_confirmbtn`) need live verification against a current Steam trade offer page before implementation — these selectors are the highest-risk unknown in the milestone.
